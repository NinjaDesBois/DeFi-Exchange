## Requirements
Build an exhange with only one asset pair Eth <> Crypto Dev (For crypto Dev here the link of repo :https://github.com/NinjaDesBois/ICO-Initial-Coin-Offering-)
This Decentralized Exchange should take a fees of 1% on swaps
When user adds liquidity, they should be given Crypto Dev LP tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens)
CD LP tokens should be given propotional to the Ether user is willing to add to the liquidity

## Functional Requirements
We need to allow for the following functionality at least to build an automated market maker:
- Anyone can add liquidity to become a liquidity provider
- Liquidity providers can remove their liquidity and get back their crypto whenever they want
- Users can swap between assets present in the trading pool, assuming there is enough liquidity
- Users are charged a small trading fees, that gets distributed amongst the liquidity providers so they can earn for providing liquidity
